          <h3>Interview Tips</h3>
          <p>
          From the time you are contacted by a potential employer concerning an interview time/date, there are several steps that must be taken to ensure that you are well-prepared for your job interview. Your success or failure at a job interview is largely determined by your state of preparedness or unpreparedness as the case may be.

          <h3>Before the Interview</h3>
          <p>
          •	Research the organisation: Take time to familiarise yourself with information about the organisation as potential employees tend to ask interviewees what they know about their organisations. An unprepared person may be stranded if faced with this question. Find out what the organisation does and major projects they have handled. Information concerning most modern organisations can be accessed via the Internet using common search engines such as Google or Wikipedia. Otherwise, secondary sources may be relied upon such as print media, friends, colleagues etc.
          </p>
          <p>
•	Connect yourself to the job requirements: Find out the job role/description and person specifications required for the job and think about how your education, previous experience, skills and interests fit the job. It is important to think (and possibly make notes) about the qualities that make you the fitting person for the specific job.
</p>
<p>
•	Stay up-to-date with the general trends in your job industry: Research current affairs in your job area. You may not need to invest all of your time on this but it is advantageous to be comfortable discussing current news in your job area.
</p>
<p>
•	Prepare for likely questions: You should anticipate the kind of questions that you are most likely to be asked for the job, and then prepare your answers to these questions. These should also include commonly asked questions such as “Tell us about yourself?” and “Why do you want to work for this organisation?” You can practise your answers to anticipated questions with a trusted friend and roughly assess yourself based on his/her feedback.
</p>
<p>
•	Try to find out the interview format (such as single or panel) if it was not specified within your invitation. Get yourself comfortable with the idea of facing a group of interviewers or having a one-on-one interview, as the case may be.
</p>
<p>
•	Utilise the Internet to your full advantage: In this modern age, the Internet grants you access to information resources that were previously unobtainable. For major organisations, it is usually very easy to pull up useful information concerning their recruitment procedures. For smaller organisations, you might not find very much information but you would be surprised at how much you can find with a random Google search, for example. Online job forums are also very useful for finding information on the recruitment procedures of many organisations.
</p>
<p>
•	Prepare what you intend to wear [preferably] a day before: Try to look your best. Remember: the first impression an interviewer has of you is very important. Typically, formal/corporate wear and suits are the best “dress code” for interviews.
</p>
<p>
•	Plan your journey to arrive for your interview about 30 minutes early. This gives you enough time to be refreshed and get yourself comfortable before your interview. You should take enough money to cover all your anticipated expenses so you don’t get stranded midway or have to spend unplanned time using an ATM or going to the bank. If you don’t know to locate the address, you can ask friends for a detailed description, use address finding mobile applications available for smartphones or ask kind-hearted people around. As a last resort, do not hesitate to contact the organisation for direction.
</p>
<p>
•	Go to bed early: Get an early night so that you can wake up fully refreshed and ‘good to go’. You don’t want to look stressed up during your interview, do you? Or worse, can you imagine dozing off while waiting to be interviewed??? So go to bed early!

          <h3>What to take to your Job Interview</h3>
          <p>
          In most cases, it is required that you take all or the combination of the following:
          <ul>
          <li>At least two hard copies of your CV and your application/covering letter and personal notes.</li>
		<li>Officially recognised photo identification such as Driver’s Licence, International Passport, National ID Card or any other specified identification.</li>
		<li>All examination certificates usually starting from secondary school level such as WASSCE/WAEC, NECO, GCE; Tertiary certificates such as OND, HND, Bachelor’s degree, Master’s degree and other relevant certificates and degree awards, as the case may be.</li>
		<li>NYSC Certificate or exemption, as the case may be.</li>
        <li>Passport photographs (preferably 1-4 copies).</li>
		<li>Letter of Reference/Recommendation (if applicable).</li>
		<li>All applicable evidence as stated in your CV such as special recognitions and awards etc.</li>
		<li>You might also want to carry a pen and notebook.</li>
          </ul>
          

Make sure everything you intend to take to the interview is prepared a day before as the process of locating some old documents is sometimes time-consuming.

        <h3>During the Interview</h3>
       <p>
        Making the right impression: If you followed all the tips from the “Before the Interview” section, you should:
        <ul>
        <li>Arrive in good time for your interview.</li>
    	<li>Be appropriately dressed for the interview.</li>
        <li>Take along with you all required documents for the interview.</li>
    	<li>Be well-organised, refreshed and well-rested.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
    All of these help you to stand out as an excellent candidate for the job. Furthermore, it is necessary to:
       <ul>
    	<li>Listen attentively to questions and answer them accordingly, without wandering away from the main point.</li>
    	<li>Watch your ‘body language’. Speak confidently and audibly while maintaining eye contact with your interviewer(s). Sit straight! It gives you a more confident and professional outlook.</li>
   		<li>Smile and be courteous. Don’t overdo the smiling or laugh uncontrollably so that you won’t be mistaken as unprofessional or unserious.</li>
       </ul>

        <h3>Overcoming Nervousness during an Interview</h3>
        
        <p>
        It is possible for one to forget something as simple as the National Anthem due to nervousness. One crucial way to overcome this is by being adequately prepared for the interview, as already discussed in previous sections. Preparation reduces the anxiety and fear associated with unpreparedness. Likewise, it is necessary to:
        <ul>
			<li>Reflect: Take time to think about your research about the organisation and the special qualities you have to offer them.</li>
			<li>Refresh your memory by skimming through important notes that you have taken during your preparation stage. You can take your notes along with you during the interview. You can boldly write some keynotes to remind you of some points you want to elaborate on.</li>
			<li>Relax: Don’t rush into the questions as they are asked. Listen first, and then think about an answer before responding. Be sure you understand the question before providing an answer.</li>
			<li>Do not hesitate to politely ask your interviewer to repeat or clarify a question if you are not sure of its meaning.</li>
			<li>Use practical examples of your personal experiences that you have gathered from different areas of your life such as work, childhood and educational experience. It is usually more comfortable using personal examples to support point.</li>
			<li>Flow: Enjoy the interview. Many interviews turn out to be a bit different from what you anticipated, so just flow with the moment and try to enjoy the experience with enthusiasm.</li>
			<li>Breathe: It is a very effective strategy to relax one’s nerves.</li>
		</ul>

        <h3>Answering Common Interview Questions</h3>
        
        <p>
        In order to gather relevant information about applicants, interviewers tend to ask questions building on information already provided in your CV. This helps to verify that details provided in your CV and also to get to know more about your suitability for the required job. Interview questions typically cover areas such as:
•	Educational experience and achievements
•	Work experience
•	Personal qualities such as being hardworking and honesty
•	Personal skills such as leadership and communication skills
•	Personal motivation and goals
•	Knowledge of the organisation
Common questions in the mentioned areas may be asked in different forms such as:
•	What are your educational achievements till date?
•	What were your roles and responsibilities working at Company X?
•	What personal qualities make you suited for this organisation?
•	What skills make you the right candidate for the job?
•	Where do you see yourself in 5yrs from now?
•	What do you know about this organisation?
Other common interview questions take various forms such as:
•	Who are you?
•	Talk about yourself
•	Why do you want to work for us?
•	Why did you study your course?
•	Who are we? What do we do?
•	What makes you different from other applicants?
Be ready to answer common interview questions and get comfortable with your prepared answers. It is unwise to assume your interviewer has already read through your CV because in many cases the application may be so voluminous that the interviewer can’t afford more than a glance at your CV. Answer every question appropriately, even if it is already in your CV.
Remember: Prepare answers to every one of the common interview questions and practise your proposed responses with a friend.

        <h3>Answering Difficult Interview Questions</h3>
        
        <p>
        Interviewers may purposely ask you extremely difficult questions that they don’t necessarily expect you to have an answer to. Most times it helps them assess how you react under intense pressure. Successfully answering such questions works greatly in your favour. However, no man is omniscient so if you find yourself faced with a very challenging question you cannot provide a definite answer to:
•	Admit you don’t know the answer, rather than lie or provide a wrong response. Some interviewers may deceptively lead you on, fully knowing that all you are saying is absolute ‘rubbish’.
•	Pause to think about it and give a logically sound response in cases where the difficult question requires your opinion on a particular matter.
•	You can even offer to further research the particular question [and provide an answer on a later date] in the event that the interviewer truly seeks an answer to the question.

        <h3>Declining Inappropriate Interview Question</h3>
        
        <p>
        In the rare event that an inappropriate [or highly unethical] question that you are uncomfortable with such as questions that are extremely personal or concerning religious opinions which you choose to keep private, you have right to politely decline the question, clearly stating your reason for not answering the question.

        <h3>Interviewing your Interviewer</h3>
        <p>
        Many interviewers will give you the opportunity to ask any questions that are relevant to the organisation. It wouldn’t hurt to have at least two questions prepared in advance. Nevertheless, if you are not provided with the luxury of asking questions, you do not have to impose it on your interviewer. During your research about the organisation you can highlight a couple of questions you would love to ask. You can structure your questions in the following suggested forms:
•	What kind of training, if any, would be provided to successful candidate(s)?
•	What is the proposed start date for the job?
•	What is the company’s stance on the allegations levelled against them in the media?
It is better to not ask any questions, than ask questions that are not carefully thought out.
